# IRIS Dashboard â€“ Frontend Development
### Task 3

This repository contains my front-end implementation of a redesigned IRIS Web Dashboard.  
The development is based on my own Task 2 Figma design.  




## Design Rationale

The redesigned dashboard transforms a static site into a fully responsive, interactive hub where students can personalize widgets and layouts. This approach solves key problems: static, one-size-fits-all interfaces, poor mobile experience, lack of instant feedback, and low engagement. With real-time notifications and modern accessibility, students get a dashboard thatâ€™s engaging, intuitive, and tailored to their needs.
