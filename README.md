# IRIS Dashboard – Frontend Development
### Task 3

This repository contains my front-end implementation of a redesigned IRIS Web Dashboard.  
The development is based on my own Task 2 Figma design.  




## Design Rationale

The redesigned dashboard transforms a static site into a fully responsive, interactive hub where students can personalize widgets and layouts. This approach solves key problems: static, one-size-fits-all interfaces, poor mobile experience. With customizable and modern accessibility, students get a dashboard that’s engaging, intuitive, and tailored to their needs.



##Features Implemented

- Quick-action widgets (Timetable, Grades, Courses, Announcements, Fees)
- Customizable for students
- Most searched links on one click
- Assignments deadline dashboard
- Modular component structure for scalability
- Mock data used for dynamic content loading
- Fully responsive layout (mobile → tablet → desktop)



## Tech Stack
